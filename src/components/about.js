            <p>
            I was raised in the east bay majority of my life,
            a beautiful place with tons of opportunities! One of many opportunities I had 
            is to go to U.C Berkely Coding Bootcamp in which I was able to learn both front-end and back-end languages, such as HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express ,and much more. I am excited to see what new career opportunities come ahead.
